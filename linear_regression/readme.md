## 📋 Project Overview

This project analyzes customer behavior data from an e-commerce company to predict yearly spending amounts using linear regression.  
It includes data visualization, model training, evaluation, residual analysis, and saving the model for future predictions.

## 📊 Dataset Information

- Source: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/kolawale/focusing-on-mobile-app-or-website)  
- CSV file: `Ecommerce Customers.csv`  

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Avg. Session Length | Average session length (minutes) |
| Time on App | Time spent on mobile app (minutes) |
| Time on Website | Time spent on website (minutes) |
| Length of Membership | Membership duration (years) |
| Yearly Amount Spent | Target variable (dollars) |

**Explanation:**  
The goal is to predict yearly spending based on customer interaction with the app/website and how long they have been members.

## 🛠 Project Steps with Explanations

### 1️⃣ Load Libraries & Dataset

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

df = pd.read_csv("assets/Ecommerce Customers.csv")
df.head()
```

*Explanation:*  
Load libraries for data analysis (`pandas`, `numpy`) and visualization (`matplotlib`, `seaborn`).  
`df.head()` shows the first rows to verify dataset structure.

---

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

```python
sns.jointplot(x="Time on Website", y="Yearly Amount Spent", data=df, alpha=0.5)
sns.jointplot(x="Time on App", y="Yearly Amount Spent", data=df, alpha=0.5)
sns.pairplot(df, kind="scatter", plot_kws={"alpha":0.5})
sns.lmplot(x="Length of Membership", y="Yearly Amount Spent", data=df,
           scatter_kws={"alpha":0.3}, line_kws={"color":"red","linestyle":"--"})
plt.show()
```

*Explanation:*  
Visualizations help identify patterns and correlations.  
- Strong positive correlation: `Length of Membership` → important predictor.  
- Moderate correlation: `Time on App`.  
- Weak correlation: `Time on Website`.

---

### 3️⃣ Split Data into Training & Test Sets

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X = df[["Avg. Session Length","Time on App","Time on Website","Length of Membership"]]
y = df["Yearly Amount Spent"]

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)
```

*Explanation:*  
- Separate features (`X`) and target (`y`).  
- Train on 70% of data, test on 30% → ensures fair evaluation.

---

### 4️⃣ Train Linear Regression Model

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

lm = LinearRegression()
lm.fit(X_train, y_train)

coef_df = pd.DataFrame(lm.coef_, X.columns, columns=["Coefficient"])
print(coef_df)
print("Intercept:", lm.intercept_)
```

*Explanation:*  
- `LinearRegression()` creates the model.  
- `fit()` trains it.  
- Coefficients indicate feature importance; intercept is the baseline.

---

### 5️⃣ Make Predictions

```python
y_pred = lm.predict(X_test)
```

*Explanation:*  
Use the trained model to predict yearly spending for test data.

---

### 6️⃣ Evaluate Model Performance

```python
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error, mean_squared_error
import numpy as np

mae = mean_absolute_error(y_test, y_pred)
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
rmse = np.sqrt(mse)

print("MAE:", mae)
print("MSE:", mse)
print("RMSE:", rmse)
```

*Explanation:*  
- **MAE:** Average error in dollars → easy to interpret.  
- **MSE:** Penalizes larger errors → useful for optimization.  
- **RMSE:** Same units as target → interpretable.  
- Low errors (~$7–$10) relative to spending range (300–700) → model is good.

---

### 7️⃣ Residual Analysis

```python
residuals = y_test - y_pred

sns.displot(residuals, bins=20, kde=True)

import pylab, scipy.stats as stats
stats.probplot(residuals, dist="norm", plot=pylab)
pylab.show()
```

*Explanation:*  
- Residuals = actual – predicted.  
- Random, normal distribution → assumptions of linear regression satisfied.

---

### 8️⃣ Visualize Predictions vs Actual

```python
sns.scatterplot(x=y_pred, y=y_test)
plt.xlabel("Predicted")
plt.ylabel("Actual")
plt.title("Predicted vs Actual Yearly Amount Spent")
plt.show()
```

*Explanation:*  
- Points near the diagonal → accurate predictions.  
- Confirms model reliability visually.

---

### 9️⃣ Save Trained Model

```python
import joblib
joblib.dump(lm, "./assets/linear_regression_model.pkl")
```

*Explanation:*  
- Save model to disk for reuse.  
- Load later for new predictions:

```python
lm = joblib.load("./assets/linear_regression_model.pkl")
new_customer = [[34.5, 12.65, 39.57, 4.08]]
predicted_spent = lm.predict(new_customer)
print("Predicted Yearly Amount Spent:", predicted_spent)
```

## 📈 Key Findings

### Model Coefficients
| Feature | Coefficient | Impact |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Avg. Session Length | 25.98 | Positive |
| Time on App | 38.59 | Strong positive |
| Time on Website | 0.19 | Minimal |
| Length of Membership | 61.27 | Strongest positive |

### Model Performance
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** $7.23  
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** $79.81  
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** $8.93  

**Business Implications:**  
1. Invest in the mobile app → increases customer spending.  
2. Website improvements have minimal effect.  
3. Reward long-term members → strongest impact on spending.
